  <h2>Reflection Essay</h2>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned over the past few years, it’s that real-world experience will teach you more than any textbook or discussion post ever could. That’s not to say school didn’t teach me anything, it absolutely did, but it’s the mix of classroom learning, job experience, and personal projects that really shaped who I am as a tech professional. This reflection is about taking a step back and looking at everything I’ve done: the skills I’ve built, the things I’ve made, and the lessons I’ve learned along the way.</p>
  <p>Between my coursework at ODU, hands-on experience at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, and my current role supporting the U.S. Navy, I’ve steadily developed three key skillsets that define my work: <strong>technical innovation, information management, and secure network design.</strong> These aren’t just buzzwords, I’ve used these skills in freezing tunnels, on-call at 2AM, and while building custom tools to solve real problems. The artifacts in this portfolio reflect those experiences, whether they were sparked in a class assignment, refined on the job, or built entirely from scratch at home.</p>

  <hr>
  <h3>Skill 1: Technical Innovation</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Artifact 1:</strong> Custom VHF Radio<br/>
    <strong>Artifact 2:</strong> DIY ROV Project<br/>
    <strong>Artifact 3:</strong> Commercial-Grade Radio Upgrades at CBBT
  </p>
  <p>Innovation, to me, means not waiting around for someone else to build what you need. My DIY VHF radio project started as a hobby but quickly turned into something much bigger. I didn’t just want a radio, I wanted one that supported trunking, encryption, and could be programmed over the air. There was no off-the-shelf option that did what I wanted, well there was but I got quoted 6,500 dollars to buy it, so I started learning everything I could about front panel programing (FPP), CHIRP support (radio programing software), and custom firmware.</p>
  <p>At the same time, I was knee-deep in building a tethered ROV powered by a Raspberry Pi. The whole thing started in my garage and turned into a full-on engineering challenge. I designed swiveling thruster pods, Ethernet-based control, and leak detection, all without a formal blueprint. I also leveraged my experience in networking to build my own TCP/IP type protocol for communication.  These builds taught me more about electronics, embedded systems, and systems thinking than any single course.</p>
  <p>But these weren’t just at-home projects. At CBBT, I became the unofficial “radio guy” for our department. I researched, designed, and upgraded our existing analog systems, working toward digital replacements before the Statewide Agencies Radio System Program (STARS) system goes away in 2029. That real-world experience of planning system upgrades especially for critical infrastructure pushed my understanding of wireless communications to another level. Innovation isn’t just about having an idea, it’s about getting your hands dirty and building it. These artifacts show that I don’t just talk about tech. I built it.</p>

  <h3>Skill 2: Information Management</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Artifact 1:</strong> Internal Web Dashboard<br/>
    <strong>Artifact 2:</strong> Custom Password Manager at CBBT<br/>
    <strong>Artifact 3:</strong> CYSE 368 Internship Report
  </p>

  <p>Managing information sounds boring until you realize how critical it is to doing your job right, and keeping systems secure. At CBBT, I worked on everything from maintaining Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems to designing internal dashboards that help track assets, credentials, and workflows. When our internal password manager started showing its age, I rebuilt it from the ground up using PocketBase and custom JavaScript. The result? A tool our whole department now uses daily.</p>
  <p>That same mindset led me to create a self-hosted internal dashboard outside of work. It was a personal project, but it mirrored the same problems I saw in the field: keeping things organized, accessible, and secure. I built it to manage diagrams, passwords, and monitoring tools, and it runs smoothly thanks to the careful planning I put into the backend.</p>
  <p>My CYSE 368 internship paper dives into these projects in detail, but more importantly, it shows how much I care about making useful tools, not just checking boxes. Anyone can build a spreadsheet. Making something people actually use? That’s the real challenge.</p>

  <hr>
  <h3>Skill 3: Secure Network Design</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Artifact 1:</strong> Wireless Network Design Plan (Job-Aligned)<br/>
    <strong>Artifact 2:</strong> Network Infrastructure Upgrades at CBBT<br/>
    <strong>Artifact 3:</strong> Security+ and Network+ Certifications
  </p>

  <p>This skill really came into focus when I started working full-time in the field. CBBT isn’t just a bridge, it’s a complex, 22-mile long piece of infrastructure with thousands of devices that all need to stay online and secure. One of my biggest projects was helping overhaul the admin building’s entire network, ripping out old switches, pulling new ethernet cable, and setting up a mesh of Juniper switches for redundancy and segmentation. We cut out over five unmanaged switches and replaced them with a clean, logical setup. It was like untangling a knot made of old Ethernet cables and bad decisions.</p>
  <p>I also created a new Wireless Network Design Plan as part of a never used project at the CBBT. That artifact isn’t useless though, not all plans go anywhere and I know and understand that but the work was still put in and I wouldn't change that for anything.  I dove deep into heatmapping and other wireless specific problems to design a perfect coverage wireless mesh network with minimal overlapping interference. </p>
  <p>Security is baked into everything I do. From managing our firewall and VLANs at the bridge to pitching MFA solutions to leadership, I’m always thinking about how to protect the systems I work on. It’s not just a line on a resume, it’s how I think now.</p>

  <hr>
 <h3>Reflections on the Degree</h3>

 <p>Let’s be real for a second, some of the classes I’ve taken have felt like busywork. Writing cryptographic calculations by hand in 2025 doesn’t exactly help me secure a network. But even in the classes that didn’t feel useful in the moment, I still took away something. Sometimes that something was learning how to write a proposal (which helped me pitch cloud migration plans at work), or how to read technical policy documents. It wasn’t always hands-on, but it added to the toolkit.</p>
 <p>ODU’s cybersecurity program gave me some structure, and courses like IDS 300W taught me how to write technical reflections and make connections across disciplines. It helped me think beyond just “what do I click on to fix this,” and more about “why are we doing this in the first place?” And that’s important.</p>

 <hr>
   <h3>The Value of Interdisciplinarity</h3>

 <p>Every day at CBBT is an interdisciplinary exercise, even if I don’t always label it that way. One minute I’m crawling through a tunnel to fix a camera, the next I’m configuring firewall rules, and then I’m helping the finance team understand how their VLAN is segmented from the maintenance department. You can’t do this job unless you understand how hardware, software, policy, and people all fit together.</p>
 <p>When I was asked to support our SCADA system upgrades, it wasn’t enough to know the network side, I had to understand how those systems worked mechanically, electrically, and logistically. That’s where the interdisciplinary part shines. It’s not just about having a foot in two worlds. It’s about being the person who can bridge the gap between them.</p>

 <hr>
  <h3>Where It’s All Going</h3>

 <p>So where does all this take me? Well, I’ve realized that while I like cybersecurity, it’s not where I want to spend the rest of my career. I’m good at it, sure, but my real passion is with radio and network infrastructure. I’m chasing that by pursuing a master’s in electrical engineering starting next spring. That’s not a pivot, it’s a progression. It’s taking all the interdisciplinary skills I’ve built, security, networking, hardware, problem solving, and pushing them into a field I’ve dreamed about since I took that one high school Cisco Class</p>
 <p>This portfolio, to me, isn’t just a requirement for a class. It’s a map. It shows where I’ve been, what I’ve built, and where I’m headed next. From my high school CCNA classes to pulling fiber in subzero temperatures, I’ve learned more than any syllabus could capture.</p>
 <p>Lately, I’ve been preparing to join the Army National Guard as a signal support specialist for artillery. The idea of combining my passion for communication systems with direct support of tactical operations just makes sense to me. It’s another way to put my skills to use in a high-stakes, high-impact environment, one where radios and networks aren’t just useful, they’re mission-critical.</p>
 <p>At the same time, I’ve started working full-time as a network engineer for a government subcontractor supporting the U.S. Navy. I can’t go into too much detail about the work, but I’ll just say it’s challenged me in the best way and confirmed that I’m on the right track. Every day I get to work with real systems, solve real problems, and help support people who rely on those systems for operations and security. (and I can finally put all those cisco commands to use)</p>
 <p>Looking forward, I hope to eventually design and build radios that are relied on by both the military and civilian sectors. Whether that’s supporting emergency responders during disasters, enabling secure comms in tough environments, or contributing to defense infrastructure, I want to build technology that makes a lasting impact. That’s the kind of work I can be proud of, and that’s where all of this is headed.</p>

 <hr>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>

 <p>I’ve built systems, radios, networks, and even some resilience along the way. The nine artifacts I’ve chosen for this portfolio aren’t just random pieces, they’re the best examples of what I can do. They show how I learn, how I solve problems, and how I keep moving forward.</p>
 <p>Being in the field this whole time while earning my degree has made me look at the program differently. I’m thankful for the structure and opportunities ODU gave me, but it’s the mix of that with real experience that made all the difference. I’ve been able to take ideas from class and test them in the wild, and sometimes the wild wins. But you get better. You keep pushing.</p>
 <p>So yeah, I’m proud of this portfolio. Not because it’s perfect, but because it’s real. Every artifact, every page, every late-night fix is part of a bigger story, one that’s just getting started.</p>
